# I Make "Fake Jazz"
## Because it's made in Logic Pro
Hi! I'm Carnivorous Cannibal, and I write music! Kind of... Well, I use a MIDI controller to make music in Logic Pro, but that doesn't count as writing. So I guess I just play music and record it? Whatever that's called. Anyways, I'm trying to make jazz, but it doesn't always turn out that way. Stay tuned for more music!
